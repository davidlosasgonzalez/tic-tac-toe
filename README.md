# Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which two players alternately put `X` and `O` in compartments of a figure formed by two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines and each tries to get a row of three `X` or three `O` before the opponent does.

In this version, the game can end in three different ways:

-   Player 1 wins `X`.

-   Player 2 wins `O`.

-   Draw.

When the game ends, it can be restarted.
